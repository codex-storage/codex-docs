# Run Codex

As for now, Codex is implemented only in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) and can be found in [nim-codex](https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex) repository.

It is a command-line application which may be run in a different ways:
 - [Using binary](#using-binary)
 - [Run as a daemon in Linux](#run-as-a-daemon-in-linux) (not supported yet)
 - [Run as a service in Windows](#run-as-a-service-in-windows) (not supported yet)
 - [Using Docker](#using-docker)
 - [Using Docker Compose](#using-docker-compose)
 - [Using Ansible](#using-ansible)
 - [On Kubernetes](#on-kubernetes)

During the run, it is required to pass [configuration](#configuration) option to the application, which can be done in a different ways.

## Configuration

It is possible to configure Codex node in several ways:
 1. [CLI options](#cli-options)
 2. [Environment variables](#environment-variables)
 3. [Configuration file](#configuration-file)

The order of priority is the same as above:  
[CLI options](#cli-options) --> [Environment variables](#environment-variables) --> [Configuration file](#configuration-file).

### Common information

#### Units

For some configuration options, we can pass values in common units like:
```shell
--storage-quota=2m/2M/2mb/2MB
--cache-size

--block-ttl=2s/2S/2m/2M/2h/2H/2d/2D/2w/2W
--block-mi
```

#### Logging

Codex uses [Chronicles](https://github.com/status-im/nim-chronicles) logging library, which allows great flexibility in working with logs.
Chronicles has the concept of topics, which categorize log entries into semantic groups.

Using the `log-level` parameter, you can set the top-level log level like `--log-level="trace"`, but more importantly,
you can set log levels for specific topics like `--log-level="info; trace: marketplace,node; error: blockexchange"`,
which sets the top-level log level to `info` and then for topics `marketplace` and `node` sets the level to `trace` and so on.

### CLI options

### Environment variables

In order to set a configuration option using environment variables, first find the desired [CLI option](#cli-options)
and then transform it in the following way:

 1. prepend it with `CODEX_`
 2. make it uppercase
 3. replace `-` with `_`

For example, to configure `--log-level`, use `CODEX_LOG_LEVEL` as the environment variable name.

> [!WARNING]
> Some options can't be configured via environment variables for now. Please read [Known issues](#known-issues) for more details.

### Configuration file

A [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) configuration file can also be used to set configuration values. Configuration option names and corresponding values are placed in the file, separated by `=`. Configuration option names can be obtained from the [`codex --help`](#cli-options) command, and should not include the `--` prefix. For example, a node's log level (`--log-level`) can be configured using TOML as follows:

```toml
log-level = "trace"
```

For option, like `bootstrap-node` and `listen-addrs` which accept multiple values we can specify data as an array
```toml
listen-addrs = [
  "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/7777",
  "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/8888"
]
```

The Codex node can then read the configuration from this file using the `--config-file` CLI parameter, like `codex --config-file=/path/to/your/config.toml`.

## Run

Basically, we can run Codex in three different modes
 - [Codex node](#codex-node) - useful for local testing/development and basic/files sharing
 - [Codex node with marketplace support](#codex-node-with-marketplace-support) - main mode and should be used by the end users
 - [Codex storage node](#codex-storage-node) - should be used by storage providers or if you would like to sell your local storage

### Using binary

#### Codex node

We can run Codex in a simple way like following:
```shell
codex
```

But, it will use a default `data-dir` value and we can pass a custom one:
```shell
codex --data-dir=./datadir
```

This will run Codex as an isolated instance, and if we would like to join an existing network, it is required to pass a [bootstrap node](architecture#network-architecture). We can pass multiple nodes as well:
```shell
codex \
  --data-dir=./datadir \
  --bootstrap-node=spr:CiUIAhIhAiJvIcA_ZwPZ9ugVKDbmqwhJZaig5zKyLiuaicRcCGqLEgIDARo8CicAJQgCEiECIm8hwD9nA9n26BUoNuarCEllqKDnMrIuK5qJxFwIaosQ3d6esAYaCwoJBJ_f8zKRAnU6KkYwRAIgM0MvWNJL296kJ9gWvfatfmVvT-A7O2s8Mxp8l9c8EW0CIC-h-H-jBVSgFjg3Eny2u33qF7BDnWFzo7fGfZ7_qc9P \
  --bootstrap-node=spr:CiUIAhIhAyUvcPkKoGE7-gh84RmKIPHJPdsX5Ugm_IHVJgF-Mmu_EgIDARo8CicAJQgCEiEDJS9w-QqgYTv6CHzhGYog8ck92xflSCb8gdUmAX4ya78QoemesAYaCwoJBES39Q2RAnVOKkYwRAIgLi3rouyaZFS_Uilx8k99ySdQCP1tsmLR21tDb9p8LcgCIG30o5YnEooQ1n6tgm9fCT7s53k6XlxyeSkD_uIO9mb3
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you are using a proper value for the [network](/networks/networks) you would like to join.

Also, to make your Codex node accessible for other network participants, it is required to specify a public IP address which can be used to access your node:
```shell
codex \
  --data-dir=./datadir \
  --bootstrap-node=spr:CiUIAhIhAiJvIcA_ZwPZ9ugVKDbmqwhJZaig5zKyLiuaicRcCGqLEgIDARo8CicAJQgCEiECIm8hwD9nA9n26BUoNuarCEllqKDnMrIuK5qJxFwIaosQ3d6esAYaCwoJBJ_f8zKRAnU6KkYwRAIgM0MvWNJL296kJ9gWvfatfmVvT-A7O2s8Mxp8l9c8EW0CIC-h-H-jBVSgFjg3Eny2u33qF7BDnWFzo7fGfZ7_qc9P \
  --nat=<your public IP>
```

> [!TIP]
> We can set public IP using curl and IP lookup service, like [ip.codex.storage](https://ip.codex.storage).

After that, node will announce itself using your public IP and dynamic TCP port for [libp2p transport](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/transports/overview/) (data transfer), which can be adjusted in the following way:
```shell
codex \
  --data-dir=./datadir \
  --bootstrap-node=spr:CiUIAhIhAiJvIcA_ZwPZ9ugVKDbmqwhJZaig5zKyLiuaicRcCGqLEgIDARo8CicAJQgCEiECIm8hwD9nA9n26BUoNuarCEllqKDnMrIuK5qJxFwIaosQ3d6esAYaCwoJBJ_f8zKRAnU6KkYwRAIgM0MvWNJL296kJ9gWvfatfmVvT-A7O2s8Mxp8l9c8EW0CIC-h-H-jBVSgFjg3Eny2u33qF7BDnWFzo7fGfZ7_qc9P \
  --nat=`curl -s https://ip.codex.storage` \
  --listen-addrs=/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/8070
```

In that way, node will announce itself using the following [multiaddress](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/fundamentals/addressing/):

`/ip4/<your public IP>/tcp/8070`

and we can check that via [API](https://api.codex.storage/#tag/Debug/operation/getDebugInfo) call:
```shell
curl -s localhost:8080/api/codex/v1/debug/info | jq -r '.announceAddresses'
```
```json
[
  "/ip4/<your public IP>/tcp/8070"
]
```
Basically, for P2P communication we should set/adjust two ports:
| # | Protocol function                                                        | CLI option       | Example                                |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1 | [Discovery](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/discovery-routing/overview/) | `--disc-port`    | `--disc-port=8090`                     |
| 2 | [Transport](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/transports/overview/)        | `--listen-addrs` | `--listen-addrs=/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/8070` |

And, also it is required to setup port-forwarding on your Internet device, please read [Known issues](#known-issues) for more details.

So, a fully working basic configuration will looks like following:
```shell
codex \
  --data-dir=./datadir \
  --bootstrap-node=spr:CiUIAhIhAiJvIcA_ZwPZ9ugVKDbmqwhJZaig5zKyLiuaicRcCGqLEgIDARo8CicAJQgCEiECIm8hwD9nA9n26BUoNuarCEllqKDnMrIuK5qJxFwIaosQ3d6esAYaCwoJBJ_f8zKRAnU6KkYwRAIgM0MvWNJL296kJ9gWvfatfmVvT-A7O2s8Mxp8l9c8EW0CIC-h-H-jBVSgFjg3Eny2u33qF7BDnWFzo7fGfZ7_qc9P \
  --nat=`curl -s https://ip.codex.storage` \
  --disc-port=8090 \
  --listen-addrs=/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/8070
```

After node is up and running and port-forwarding configurations was done, we should be able to [Upload a file](https://github.com/codex-storage/codex-testnet-starter/blob/master/USINGCODEX.md#upload-a-file)/[Download a file](https://github.com/codex-storage/codex-testnet-starter/blob/master/USINGCODEX.md#download-a-file) in the network. And to be able to purchase storage, we should run [Codex node with marketplace support](#codex-node-with-marketplace-support).

#### Codex node with marketplace support

[Marketplace](/learn/architecture.md#marketplace-architecture) support permits to purchase the storage in Codex network. Basically, we should add just a `persistence` sub-command and required CLI options to the [previous run](#codex-node).

> [!NOTE]
> Please ignore `--eth-account` CLI option, read [Known issues](#known-issues) for more details.

1. For a daily use, we should consider to run a local blockchain node based on the [network](/networks/networks) you would like to join. That process is described in the [Join Testnet](/networks/testnet)(:construction:), but for quick start we can use a public RPC endpoint.

2. Create a file with ethereum private key and set a proper permissions.
   ```shell
   key=$(curl -s https://key.codex.storage)
   echo $key | awk -F ':' '/address/ {print $2}' >eth.address
   echo $key | awk -F ':' '/private/ {print $2}' >eth.key
   chmod 600 eth.key
   ```
   > [!CAUTION]
   > Please use mentioned key generation service for demo purpose only.

3. Specify bootstrap nodes and marketplace address based on the [network](/networks/networks) you would like to join.

4. Run the node
   ```shell
   codex \
     persistence \
     --data-dir=./datadir \
     --bootstrap-node=spr:CiUIAhIhAiJvIcA_ZwPZ9ugVKDbmqwhJZaig5zKyLiuaicRcCGqLEgIDARo8CicAJQgCEiECIm8hwD9nA9n26BUoNuarCEllqKDnMrIuK5qJxFwIaosQ3d6esAYaCwoJBJ_f8zKRAnU6KkYwRAIgM0MvWNJL296kJ9gWvfatfmVvT-A7O2s8Mxp8l9c8EW0CIC-h-H-jBVSgFjg3Eny2u33qF7BDnWFzo7fGfZ7_qc9P \
     --nat=`curl -s https://ip.codex.storage` \
     --disc-port=8090 \
     --listen-addrs=/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/8070 \
     --eth-provider=https://rpc.testnet.codex.storage \
     --eth-private-key=eth.key \
     --marketplace-address=0xB119d28d3A1bFD281b23A0890B4c1B626EE8F6F0
   ```

After node is up and running, you just need to fill-up your ethereum address (`cat eth.address`) with the tokens and then you should be able to [Purchase storage](https://github.com/codex-storage/codex-testnet-starter/blob/master/USINGCODEX.md#purchase-storage).

#### Codex storage node

Codex [storage node](architecture#network-architecture) should be run by storage providers or in case you would like to sell your local storage. For that, we should use configuration for [Codex node with marketplace support](#codex-node-with-marketplace-support) and additionally use `prover` sub-command and required CLI options.

That sub-command will make Codex to listen for a proof request on the blockchain and answer them. To compute an answer for the proof request, Codex will use stored data and circuit files generated by the code in the [codex-storage-proofs-circuits](https://github.com/codex-storage/codex-storage-proofs-circuits) repository.

Every [network](/networks/networks) uses its own generated set of the files which are stored in the [codex-contracts-eth](https://github.com/codex-storage/codex-contracts-eth/tree/master/verifier/networks) repository and also uploaded to the CDN. Hash of the set is also known by the marketplace smart contract.

To download circuit files and make them available to Codex app, we have a stand-alone utility - `cirdl`. It can be compiled from the sources (`make cirdl`) or downloaded from the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/releases) (work in progress - [Rework circuit downloader #882](https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/pull/882)).

You would need to pass a bootstrap nodes, blockchain RPC endpoint and marketplace address based on the [network](/networks/networks) you would like to join.

1. Download circuit files
   ```shell
   # Create circuit files folder
   mkdir -p ./datadir/circuit

   # Download circuit files
   cirdl \
     ./datadir/circuit \
     https://rpc.testnet.codex.storage \
     0xB119d28d3A1bFD281b23A0890B4c1B626EE8F6F0
   ```

2. Start Codex storage node
   ```shell
     codex \
       persistence \
       prover \
       --data-dir=./datadir \
       --bootstrap-node=spr:CiUIAhIhAiJvIcA_ZwPZ9ugVKDbmqwhJZaig5zKyLiuaicRcCGqLEgIDARo8CicAJQgCEiECIm8hwD9nA9n26BUoNuarCEllqKDnMrIuK5qJxFwIaosQ3d6esAYaCwoJBJ_f8zKRAnU6KkYwRAIgM0MvWNJL296kJ9gWvfatfmVvT-A7O2s8Mxp8l9c8EW0CIC-h-H-jBVSgFjg3Eny2u33qF7BDnWFzo7fGfZ7_qc9P \
       --nat=`curl -s https://ip.codex.storage` \
       --disc-port=8090 \
       --listen-addrs=/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/8070 \
       --eth-provider=https://rpc.testnet.codex.storage \
       --eth-private-key=eth.key \
       --marketplace-address=0xB119d28d3A1bFD281b23A0890B4c1B626EE8F6F0 \
       --circom-r1cs=./datadir/circuits/proof_main.r1cs \
       --circom-wasm=./datadir/circuits/proof_main.wasm \
       --circom-zkey=./datadir/circuits/proof_main.zkey
   ```

After node is up and running, you just need to fill-up your ethereum address (`cat eth.address`) with the tokens and then you should be able to [Create storage availability](https://github.com/codex-storage/codex-testnet-starter/blob/master/USINGCODEX.md#create-storage-availability).

# Requirements

> **Note:** Using the Codex Installer is the recommended only if you agree to provide your node information to make the Codex experience better. If you don't agree to the disclaimer, please consider [setting up Codex manually](/learn/quick-start.md)

<br />

To make sure that your Codex node is running smoothly, you will need to make sure that your machine has the following requirements :

## Dependencies

- git
- npm

## Port Forwarding

Codex requires two ports to be open on your machine in order to function properly :

   | Protocol | Service   | Port   |
   | -------- | --------- | ------ |
   | UDP      | Discovery | `8090` |
   | TCP      | Transport | `8070` |

If you are not familiar with port forwarding, you can follow the instructions [here](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide/).

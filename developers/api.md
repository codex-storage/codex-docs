# Codex API

 Codex uses REST API to interact with the node and we can use HTTP client for interaction and configuration.

 API specification can be found on the [api.codex.storage](https://api.codex.storage) and it is generated based on [openapi.yaml](https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/blob/master/openapi.yaml).

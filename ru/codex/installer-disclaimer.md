# Codex Testnet Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies exclusively when you access the Codex testnet through the Command Line Interface (CLI) installer provided by us. It is designed to inform you about the personal data we collect and process, our approach to that collection and processing, and your rights when you participate in the Codex Testnet Programme using our CLI installer. For the avoidance of doubt, your participation in the Codex Testnet Programme is subject to the [Codex Testnet Terms and Conditions](https://docs.codex.storage/networks/testnet).

Before using the CLI installer to participate in the Codex Testnet Programme, please review this privacy policy carefully. By agreeing to use our CLI installer to participate in the Codex Testnet Programme, you acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is applicable to your use of the testnet through our provided CLI tool.

## Who We Are

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy and the collection and processing of personal data as a controller, the relevant entity is **IFT Studio Pte Ltd.**, a company duly organised and registered under the laws of Singapore, having its registered office at:

**160 Robinson Road, #24-09, Singapore 068914**

Whenever we refer to **“IFT”**, **“we”**, **“us”**, or any other similar references, we are referring to IFT Studio Pte Ltd.

## Data Collection and Processing

We limit the collection and processing of personal data from your participation in the Codex Testnet Programme. We only collect and process certain personal data for specific purposes and where we have the legal basis to do so under applicable data protection law, and in this case, with your explicit consent. 

We will not collect or process any personal data that we don’t need, and where we do store any personal data, we will only store it for the least amount of time needed for the indicated purpose.

### Personal Data We Collect

We collect and process the following personal data as a result of your participation in the Codex Testnet Programme:

#### **Wallet Addresses**
In order to provide you with Codex Testnet tokens and facilitate your participation in the Codex Testnet Programme, we may collect and process two types of blockchain addresses from you. This data processing is necessary for the performance of our contract with you to participate in the testnet.

The information we collect includes:

- **Codex testnet address** – Used to distribute Codex testnet tokens, allowing you to interact with the storage contracts and trigger “persistence mode” on the Codex testnet.
- **Live L1/L2 Ethereum public address** – Used for potential future network-related distributions and community engagement initiatives.

These addresses are collected through our automated CLI installer or can be manually submitted via our Discord bot, depending on your method of installation. Your participation in the testnet and provision of these addresses constitutes your agreement to this data collection and processing. 

You have the right to withdraw from the Codex testnet at any time, in which case we will cease processing this data.

#### **Node and Network Information**
To improve the future functionality, performance, and security of Codex, we collect and process technical information from users participating in the Codex testnet. We rely on our **legitimate interest** as the legal basis for this data processing activity.

The information we collect includes:

- **Node ID**
- **Peer ID**
- **Public IP address**
- **Codex node version**
- **Number of connected peers**
- **Discovery and listening ports**
- **Discord Handle** (associated with your Node ID)

We will retain this data only for as long as strictly necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined above and in compliance with applicable privacy laws. 

While we believe this data processing is necessary and proportionate to our legitimate interests, you may exercise your **right to object** or any other rights available to you as set out in this Privacy Policy and applicable data protection law. 

> **Note:** Opting out may prevent you from being able to participate in the testnet.

We are committed to **data minimization** and **purpose limitation**. After the mainnet launch of Codex, all personal data collected during the testnet phase will be securely deleted.

## Third-Party Processing of Personal Data

In addition to our limited collection of personal data, **third parties may collect or process your personal data** as part of your participation in the Codex Testnet Programme, particularly when we use their services to facilitate your participation.

When you interact with these third parties, **their respective privacy policies will govern** the collection and use of your data. We encourage you to review these privacy policies to understand how your personal data may be handled by these third parties.

## Security Measures We Take

As a general approach, we take **data security** seriously and have implemented a variety of **security measures** to maintain the safety of your personal data when you submit such information to us.

## Exporting Personal Data Outside Singapore

We are obliged to protect the privacy of personal data that you may have submitted in the unlikely event that we export your personal data outside Singapore.

This means that personal data will only be processed in **countries or by parties that provide an adequate level of protection** comparable to the relevant data protection laws in Singapore. Otherwise, we will use **other forms of protections**, such as specific **contractual clauses**, to ensure such personal data is provided the same protection as required under such legislation.

In any event, the transmission of personal data outside Singapore will always occur in conformity with applicable data protection laws.

## Your Choices and Rights

As explained in this Privacy Policy, we **limit our collection and processing** of your personal data wherever possible. Nonetheless, you still have certain **choices and rights** regarding the personal data we do collect and process.

According to relevant privacy legislation, you have the right to:

- **Request corrections or updates** to your personal data (where reasonably possible).
- **Request the removal** of your personal data from our systems.
- **Request a copy** of your personal data, which may also be transferred to another data controller at your request.
- **Withdraw your consent** to process your personal data (only if consent was asked for a processing activity). This only affects processing activities based on consent and does not affect the validity of such processing before withdrawal.
- **Object to the processing** of your personal data.
- **File a complaint** with the Personal Data Protection Committee of Singapore (PDPC) if you believe your personal data has been processed unlawfully.

## This Privacy Policy Might Change

We may modify or replace any part of this Privacy Policy **at any time and without notice**. Please check the Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. 

> **Note:** The new Privacy Policy will be effective **immediately** upon posting.

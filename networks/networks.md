# Codex networks

 At Codex, we are launching several networks which are used for different purposes
 | Network            | Status                  | Blockchain                                                              | Purpose                                                                 |
 | ------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 | Devnet             | :building_construction: | [Geth PoA](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/private-network) | Dedicated for development purposes and following latest `master` builds |
 | [Testnet](testnet) | :white_check_mark:      | [Geth PoA](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/private-network) | A public network for testing purposes, following latest releases        |
 | Mainnet            | :construction:          | :construction:                                                          | A main public network                                                   |

 The main difference between networks are following
 - Network purpose
 - Bootstrap nodes
 - Number of storage nodes
 - Available storage volume
 - Blockchain network
 - Marketplace contract version
 - Circuit files set used for proof verification

 The easiest way to start to use Codex is to [Join Testnet](testnet).
